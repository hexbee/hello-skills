- Neutral = 1 point
- Negative = 0 points

Total score = 12 points (max)

| Score Range | Assessment | Suggested Focus |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0-4 | Passive learning mode | Rethink learning goals |
| 5-8 | Conscious but not internalized | Increase output and restructuring |
| 9-12 | First principles driven | Strengthen practice verification |
