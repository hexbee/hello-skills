## 1. Math & Logic Models

### Compound Interest

**Definition**: Growth where earnings generate additional earnings over time.

**Formula**: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

**Application Patterns**:
- Business: Reinvested profits compounding over years
- Career: Skills building on skills over decades
- Debt: Negative compound interest destroys wealth
- Knowledge: Each concept unlocks understanding of more concepts

**Warning Signs**:
- "Just 5% more growth" ignored over long timeframes
- Short-term thinking masking exponential effects

---

### Permutations & Combinations

**Definition**: Counting all possible outcomes and their probabilities.

**Application Patterns**:
- Career options: Multiple variables affecting success probability
- Investment: Portfolio combinations and risk distribution
- Life decisions: Sequential vs simultaneous choices

**Key Insight**: Often we undercount the number of possible outcomes, leading to overconfidence.

---

### Fermat-Pascal System

**Definition**: Expected value calculation using probability theory.

**Application Patterns**:
- "Is this bet worth it?" → Calculate expected value
- Career transitions: Probability of success × upside vs status quo
- Business investments: Risk-adjusted returns

**Formula**: EV = (Probability of Win × Win Amount) - (Probability of Loss × Loss Amount)

---

### Pareto Principle (80/20)

**Definition**: Roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.

**Application Patterns**:
- Business: 20% of customers drive 80% of revenue
- Productivity: 20% of tasks produce 80% of value
- Problems: Fix the vital few, ignore the trivial many

**Warning Signs**:
- Treating all tasks as equally important
- Spending equal time on small and large opportunities

---

### Redundancy/Margin of Safety

**Definition**: Building buffers to account for uncertainty and error.

**Application Patterns**:
- Engineering: Bridges support 3x expected load
- Career: Multiple income streams
- Business: Cash reserves for downturns
- Investment: Buy at 30% discount from intrinsic value

**Key Quote**: "Margin of safety is the difference between the intrinsic value and the price you pay."

---

## 2. Psychology Models

### Incentive-Caused Bias

**Definition**: People predictably act in ways that serve their incentives, often unconsciously.

**Application Patterns**:
- Financial advisors recommending products that pay highest commissions
- Managers promoting projects that make them look good
- Employees optimizing for metrics, not outcomes
- Doctors recommending profitable procedures

**Detection**: Ask "Who benefits?" and "What incentives are at play?"

---

### Social Proof

**Definition**: People do what they see others doing, especially in uncertainty.

**Application Patterns**:
- Investment bubbles: Everyone buying because everyone else is buying
- Career choices: Following the crowd into oversaturated fields
- Business: Competitor analysis as validation

**Countermeasure**: Independent thinking required when crowd is unanimous.

---

### Deprivation Super-Reaction

**Definition**: The pain of losing is psychologically twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining.

**Application Patterns**:
- Holding losing investments too long to avoid realizing loss
- Staying in bad relationships due to "sunk cost"
- Rejecting small risks that could prevent larger future losses

**Thiele's Observation**: "The mind overweights small losses and underweights small gains."

---

### Reciprocity

**Definition**: Strong psychological need to return favors.

**Application Patterns**:
- Free samples → feeling obligated to buy
- Business dinners → influence on decisions
- Political favors → quid pro quo expectations

**Warning**: Reciprocity can corrupt judgment subtly.

---

### Authority Bias

**Definition**: Following authority figures without independent verification.

**Application Patterns**:
- Following investment advice from "experts" without due diligence
- Accepting industry dogma without questioning
- Hiring prestigious but wrong people

**Countermeasure**: Always ask "What would this person gain from telling me this?"

---

### Halo Effect

**Definition**: One positive trait causes overall positive judgment.

**Application Patterns**:
- Attractive people judged as more competent
- Prestigious school = assumed intelligence
- Past success = assumed future success

**Countermeasure**: Evaluate each dimension independently.

---

## 3. Economics Models

### Opportunity Cost

**Definition**: The value of the next best alternative you give up when making a choice.

**Application Patterns**:
- "Should I go to grad school?" → Cost = 2 years salary + tuition
- "Should I start a business?" → Cost = salary + benefits + savings at risk
- Time allocation: Every hour spent on X is an hour not on Y

**Key Insight**: Most decisions are made without considering what you're giving up.

---

### Economic Moat

**Definition**: Sustainable competitive advantage that protects profits from competition.

**Types**:
1. **Network Effect**: More users → more value → harder to displace
2. **Switching Costs**: Pain to switch to alternatives
3. **Economies of Scale**: Cost advantage from volume
4. **Proprietary IP**: Patents, trade secrets
5. **Brand**: Customer loyalty and recognition

**Application**: Evaluate any business by asking "How defensible is this position?"

---

### Economies of Scale

**Definition**: Costs per unit decrease as volume increases.

**Application Patterns**:
- Large companies can afford R&D smaller firms cannot
- Volume purchasing discounts
- Fixed costs spread across more units

**Warning**: Bureaucracy can negate scale advantages (dysscaleia).

---

### Tragedy of the Commons

**Definition**: Shared resources get overused because individual incentives conflict with collective good.

**Application Patterns**:
- Overfishing shared waters
- Overcrowding in popular career fields
- Social media attention as a commons

**Solutions**: Privatization, regulation, or tribal enforcement.

---

## 4. Hard Science Models

### Critical Mass

**Definition**: Threshold where a chain reaction becomes self-sustaining.

**Application Patterns**:
- Network effects reaching tipping point
- Business models requiring minimum scale to be profitable
- Skills development requiring sufficient practice time

**Key Question**: "Are we past or before the critical mass point?"

---

### Natural Selection

**Definition**: Survival of the fittest in competitive environments.

**Application Patterns**:
- Business ecosystems: Only adapted firms survive
- Career fields: Those who adapt thrive
- Investment: Market selects for survival

**Insight**: Evolution is relentless; stagnation leads to extinction.

---

### Second Law of Thermodynamics

**Definition**: Entropy (disorder) always increases in closed systems.

**Application Patterns**:
- Organizations naturally become more bureaucratic over time
- Relationships require constant energy to maintain
- Knowledge systems decay without active maintenance

**Implication**: Fighting entropy requires continuous effort.

---

### Catalyst

**Definition**: Factors that accelerate or slow down processes without being consumed.

**Application Patterns**:
- Regulatory changes catalyze industry consolidation
- Key hires catalyze company culture changes
- Technology shifts catalyze business model disruption

**Use Case**: Identify catalysts to predict timing of outcomes.

---

## 5. Core Thinking Tools

### Inversion

**Definition**: Work backward from the outcome you want to avoid.

**Process**:
1. Identify what you DON'T want
2. Ask "What would guarantee this bad outcome?"
3. Avoid those actions

**Famous Quote**: "Tell me where I'm going to die, so I never go there." — Munger

**Application**: Instead of "How do I succeed?" ask "How do I fail?" (usually easier to identify).

---

### Circle of Competence

**Definition**: Areas where your knowledge gives you an advantage.

**Rules**:
1. Stay inside your circle
2. Learn where your circle ends
3. Expand slowly through genuine expertise

**Warning Signs**:
- Overconfidence in unfamiliar domains
- Using "general intelligence" as substitute for specific knowledge

**Munger**: "Never play a game where you don't understand the odds."

---

### Margin of Safety

**Definition**: Build in buffers when making decisions under uncertainty.

**Applications**:
- Investment: Buy at 30% discount from calculated value
- Career: Have backup options before jumping
- Business: Maintain cash reserves
- Life: Don't bet everything on one outcome

**Key Insight**: The world is more uncertain than we think; margin of safety compensates.
