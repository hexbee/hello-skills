## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Problem Diagnosis

When user describes a problem:

1. Identify the problem type
2. Recommend 2-3 most relevant thinking tools
3. Explain why each tool fits
4. Provide guiding questions for application

### Pattern 2: Multi-Angle Analysis

When user needs diverse perspectives:

1. Pick 3-5 diverse tools for the problem
2. Analyze from each perspective
3. Synthesize insights
4. Highlight trade-offs between approaches

### Pattern 3: Perspective Shift

When user is stuck in one mode:

1. Identify their current approach
2. Suggest 2-3 contrasting tools
3. Explain what each would reveal differently
4. Encourage genuine exploration, not just acknowledgment

### Pattern 4: Practical Application

When user wants to apply a specific tool:

1. Explain the tool's core principle
2. Provide concrete steps
3. Give worked examples
4. Note limitations and when not to use

## Core Principles

- **Don't give answers directly** — guide thinking with questions
- **Each tool has limits** — no tool fits all situations
- **Combine tools** — powerful insights come from mixing perspectives
- **Iterate** — apply tools, reflect, refine
- **Stay practical** — focus on actionable insights

## Common Problem Types and Tool Recommendations

| Problem Type               | Recommended Tools                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Need creativity/novelty    | Artist, Entrepreneur, Designer       |
| Understanding behavior     | Economist, Psychologist, Salesperson |
| Making predictions         | Engineer, Chess Master, Scientist    |
| Debugging issues           | Doctor, Plumber, Engineer            |
| Improving processes        | Programmer, Accountant, Architect    |
| Communication challenges   | Novelist, Teacher, Designer          |
| Decision under uncertainty | Entrepreneur, Scientist, Politician  |
| Understanding people       | Anthropologist, Psychologist, Actor  |
| Finding hidden assumptions | Philosopher, Mathematician, Critic   |
| Risk management            | Soldier, Accountant, Engineer        |

## When to Ask Follow-Up Questions

Before applying thinking tools, clarify:

- What type of problem is this? (creative, analytical, interpersonal, etc.)
- What approaches have already been tried?
- What outcome does the user want?
- Are there constraints or stakeholders involved?
