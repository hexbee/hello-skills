## Mediocrity Trap

**Presentation**: Status quo is "bad enough but not bad enough," lacking motivation to change.

**Characteristics**:

- Terrible situations → After leaving, become proud memories
- Mediocre situations → Become "lost years"

**Escape Strategies**:

- Set a "bottom line": What conditions trigger must-change?
- Accept that "good enough" may need to give way to "better"

## Stroking the Problem

**Presentation**: Thinking about the problem repeatedly but not taking action.

**Characteristics**:
- Spending lots of time analyzing and discussing the problem
- Feeling that thinking = action
- Problem becomes part of identity

**Recognition Signals**:
- "I've been thinking about this problem..."
- Knowing more and more about the problem, but solutions aren't increasing

**Escape Strategies**:
- Distinguish "analyzing the problem" from "solving the problem"
- Set a time limit for thinking, then must act
- Ask: "Will this thinking lead to action, or just delay?"
