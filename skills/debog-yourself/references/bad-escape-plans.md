# Bad Escape Plans: Detailed Pattern Explanations

## Try Harder Fallacy

**Presentation**: Using "try harder" as a problem-solving strategy without changing methods.

**Characteristics**:
- After failure, conclusion is "not trying hard enough"
- Not analyzing failure reasons
- Repeating same methods expecting different results

**Classic Scenarios**:
- "We need to try harder in the next round!"
- "I need to be more focused/more eager"

**Cognitive Errors**:
- Assuming failure is due to effort level, not method
- Ignoring the importance of methodology

**Escape Strategies**:
- Ask: "What's wrong with my method?"
- Distinguish "effort" from "effectiveness"
- Seek feedback, especially on failure patterns

## Infinite Effort Illusion

**Presentation**: Believing you have a hidden reserve of effort.

**Characteristics**:
- "When I have time, I will..."
- "When I'm in a better state, I will..."
- Daily tasks always full, but believing there's more time in the future

**Truth**:
- No hidden effort reserve
- All effort is already allocated now
- If something remains undone = priority not high enough

**Escape Strategies**:
- Ask: "Which part of my time am I willing to trade?"
- Accept: If you really want to do it, you'll make time from elsewhere
- Admit not wanting to do it = priority not high enough

## Blaming God

**Presentation**: Attributing problems to things that cannot be changed.

**Characteristics**:
- Complaining about not having enough time
- Complaining about bad luck
- Complaining "the world isn't fair"
- Immersed in complaining but not acting

**Classic Scenarios**:
- "If only there were 25 hours in a day..."
- "If I had..., I would succeed"

**Cognitive Errors**:
- Complaining ≠ Problem solving
- Even if God exists, complaining changes nothing

**Escape Strategies**:
- Ask: "What can I do under current conditions?"
- Accept what cannot be changed
- Focus on controllable factors

## Diploma vs Toothbrushing Problems

**Presentation**: Misjudging problem nature, leading to wrong strategies.

**Diploma Problems** (one-time resolution):
- Complete and it's done
- Examples: Getting a degree, completing a project

**Toothbrushing Problems** (ongoing maintenance):
- Need to do continuously for life
- Examples: Maintaining health, relationships, emotional management

**Dangers**:
- Mistaking toothbrushing problems for diploma problems
- Expecting "one-time effort solves all"
- Abandoning the illusion of completion

**Escape Strategies**:
- Ask: "Does this problem need to be done for life, or once?"
- Accept that some things require continuous effort
- Build sustainable daily practices

## Fantastical Metamorphosis

**Presentation**: Believing your future self will naturally become a different person.

**Characteristics**:
- "I'll like this in the future"
- "I'll have motivation later"
- "Wait until the timing is right"

**Truth**:
- Won't wake up a different person
- Change requires action now
- Preferences don't change automatically

**Escape Strategies**:
- Ask: "If I had to start today, how would I do it?"
- Accept that change is gradual
- Start with small steps

## Puppeteering

**Presentation**: Trying to solve problems by controlling others.

**Characteristics**:
- "If he can..., then I can..."
- Focusing on changing others
- Ignoring your own agency

**Truth**:
- Others are as hard to change as you
- You cannot control others' behavior
- Even if others change, your problem may remain

**Escape Strategies**:
- Ask: "If the other person completely refuses to change, what can I do?"
- Focus on your controllable domain
- Accept that others have their own life scripts
