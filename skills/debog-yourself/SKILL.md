# De-bog Yourself

Use this skill when the user feels trapped, stuck, unable to move forward, or in a dilemma.

## Diagnostic Framework: Three Types of Bog

User dilemmas typically fall into one of three categories:

| Type | Characteristics | Core Question |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Insufficient Activation Energy** | User wants to change but can't act | "I know what to do, but I just can't move" |
| **Bad Escape Plans** | User is acting but using wrong methods | "I'm trying hard, but seems to be going in circles" |
| **Self-Created Bog** | User is trapped in imagined problems | "My self-imposed rules prevent me from moving forward" |

## Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Identify Which Category the User Falls Into

Use the following questions to help users self-identify:

**Signs of Insufficient Activation Energy:**

- "Do you know what you need to do?"
- "What's stopping you from starting? Fear, exhaustion, or something else?"

**Signs of Bad Escape Plans:**

- "What methods have you tried recently?"
- "What do these methods have in common?"

**Signs of Self-Created Bog:**

- "Who set these rules? You or someone else?"
- "What would you do if no one was judging you?"

### Step 2: Identify Specific Patterns

Based on the type, guide users to recognize specific patterns:

**Insufficient Activation Energy - Common Patterns:**

- **Gutterballing**: Effort in the wrong direction (helping others achieve their goals)
- **Waiting for jackpot**: Waiting for the perfect option, rejecting choices that have costs
- **Declining the dragon**: Avoiding things that require courage
- **Mediocrity trap**: Status quo is not good enough but not bad enough, lacking motivation to change
- **Stroking the problem**: Thinking about the problem repeatedly but not taking action

**Bad Escape Plans - Common Patterns:**

- **Try harder fallacy**: Believing that "trying harder" will solve the problem
- **Infinite effort illusion**: Believing you have hidden reserves of effort
- **Blaming God**: Complaining about things you can't change (like not having enough time)
- **Diploma vs toothbrushing**: Mistaking continuous problems for one-time problems
- **Fantastical metamorphosis**: Believing your future self will naturally change
- **Puppeteering**: Trying to control others to solve your problems

**Self-Created Bog - Common Patterns:**

- **Floor is lava**: Setting false and strict rules for yourself
- **Super surveillance**: Excessively concerned about world problems, believing they're all your responsibility
- **Hedgehogging**: Refusing to be influenced, even when you should listen
- **Personal problems growth ray**: Your problems are magnified, others' problems are minimized
- **Obsessing over tiny predictors**: Over-analyzing irrelevant details
- **Impossible satisfaction**: Believing satisfaction is impossible

## Guidance Strategies

### For Insufficient Activation Energy

1. **Acknowledge the cost**: Help users see the true cost of maintaining the status quo
2. **Lower the barrier to entry**: Break big actions into the smallest first step
3. **Accept imperfect options**: Any choice is better than being stuck
4. **Identify Gutterballing**: Ask "Whose goal is this effort for?"

### For Bad Escape Plans

1. **Distinguish problem types**: Is it a "diploma problem" (solved once) or a "toothbrushing problem" (ongoing maintenance)?
2. **Check your sphere of control**: Focus on what you can control
3. **Reject fantastical metamorphosis**: Change requires action now, not in the future
4. **Give up puppeteering**: Accept that you can't control others

### For Self-Created Bog

1. **Question the source of rules**: "Who set this rule?"
2. **Narrow your focus**: There are too many world problems, focus on what you can influence
3. **Distinguish real from imagined**: Is this dilemma real or did you create it?
4. **Accept reasonable solutions**: Simple methods are sometimes the correct answer

## Key Insights

- **Naming is healing**: Being able to name your dilemma is itself a form of relief
- **You're not unique**: Your dilemma pattern has been experienced by countless others
- **Beliefs create reality**: Many dilemmas are imagined, recognizing this is the first step to escaping

## Common Questions

- "When you say 'there's no way,' do you mean there's no method, or that you don't want to pay the cost?"
- "What would you do if you weren't worried about anyone's judgment?"
- "Are you solving the problem, or are you admiring it repeatedly?"
- "Is this rule you set yourself, or one set by others?"
- "How would you view your current choices one year from now?"
